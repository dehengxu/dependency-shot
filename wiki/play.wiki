=dependency-shot module for Play!=

A dependency-shot module for Play! is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/dependency-shot/downloads/list download] section

The dependency-shot module helps you to inject dependency-shot managed components into your Play! application. The injection points are defined by the usual @javax.inject.Inject annotation. 

To install this module, just unzip the file in the module directory of your Play! distribution.

You can enable the dependency-shot module by adding the following line to your application's **/conf/application.conf** file:

{{{
module.dependencyshot=${play.path}/modules/dependencyshot
}}}

Then you just have to define one, or more, dependency-shot binder using a class extending cx.ath.mancel01.dependencyshot.graph.Binder and write your bindings in the configureBindings method.
